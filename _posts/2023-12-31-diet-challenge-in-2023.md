Lack of sleep led to an increased appetite and rapid weight gain. My weight rose from 55kg to 61kg and the body fat reached 33% in the first half of 2023.  Even worse, this trend persisted, not only increasing my physical burden but also diminishing my decision-making ability, further exacerbating my fatigue. I decided to make a change and lose weight to regain my agility and assertiveness.

My top priority is to restore my energy, beginning with getting sufficient sleep. Additionally, I replaced milk-based drinks and sugary tea with sugar-free cola and pure water. This initial effort was not challenging, yet it yielded great results: a 3kg weight loss in two weeks.



The weight loss trend then plateaued, so I started to adjust my diet by reducing high-fat and high-sugar foods. During this stage, I primarily ate chicken breast, artificial crab sticks, and eggs. As a result, my weight decreased from 57.9 kg to 54.6 kg in 11 days.



Despite maintaining the dietary adjustments mentioned above, my weight did not continue to decrease. Instead, it rebounded slightly from 54.6 kg to 56 kg. To address this, I began incorporating aerobic exercise into my routine starting on September 4, 2023. I jogged about 9 km each day for three months, and my weight was reduced to 47.5kg. This marked the end of my challenge.
